CMOSSave CMOSRest CMOSChk restore corrupted CMOS from backup and check
that CMOS has not been tampered with.  Featured in Karen Kenworthy's
Windows Magazine column October 1994 and April 1995, and Fred Langa's in
1999.  It has also been bundled on the CDs that come with various books.

Note: progam is called CMOSsave (double s) not cmosave.

Naive users sometimes meddle with CMOS settings.  We need a fast way to
put the scores of subtle CMOS configuration settings back the way they
were.

Power surges can corrupt CMOS.  We need a way for a naive user to quickly
restore all the CMOS settings, (at least the first 128 bytes worth).

If the battery fails, the contents will be lost.  We need a way to restore
a known working CMOS configuration.

CMOSRest restores ALL of CMOS, including the proprietary extended COMS
settings like wait states, clock speeds, shadow RAM etc.  It does not
handle the proprietary extended cmos.

CMOSRest can also be used to toggle between two CMOS configurations, for
example with and without a removable hard drive installed.

CMOSChk can detect subtle corruption to CMOS, as might be caused by a
rogue program or a virus, something that might slow your machine or make
it unreliable.

The CMOS suite will work under DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/ME or OS/2.
It partly works under NT, Windows 2000 and XP, Vista and Windows 7.  see
comossave.manual.html for details.  However, these utilities are intended
to be used mainly within autoexec.bat during the DOS phase of the boot.
Further, there will be spurious CMOS changes when you reboot between Win95
and NT.

Why the computer chip icon?  It represents the CMOS chip on your
motherboard where the BIOS settings are stored.
