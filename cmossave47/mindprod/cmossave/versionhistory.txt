 1.0 1991-09-07 released to BIX

 1.1 1991-09-18 released to BIX
                added special check for small 64 character CMOSes.

 1.2 1991-09-19 fix spelling errors
                use CMOS.SAV instead of MyCMOS.SAV in examples

 1.3 1991-09-20 now consider fewer bytes volatile, restore more stuff.
                hints in docs about clearing CMOS.

 1.4 1991-09-21 now consider flags Status register C, offset 0C as volatile.
                fixes false alarms.

 1.5 1994-06-01 change of address and phone number
                address now appears in the banner.

 1.6 1994-08-29 more information about how CMOS bits are used.

 2.0 1994-10-01 easier configuration of CHKCMOS volatile bytes.
                smarter bat files.
                docs on different ways to use.

 2.2 1995-04-16 docs on use before experimentation

 2.3 1995-07-24 add 3F as volatile byte.  PCI Pentiums are volatile.

 3.0 1997-07-08 notes on Y2K checking
                notes on separate rescue diskettes.

 3.1 1998-10-23 new address
                Win98 ok note.

 3.2 1998-11-07 slight changes to visuals to conform with standard.
                embed Barker address

 3.3 1999-10-04 document problems with NT
                CMOSREST now does a read to verify that the restore succeeded.

 3.4 2000-05-10 also treat byte 38 as volatile.

 3.5 2001-01-05 also treat byte 30 as volatile at request of Sony.

 3.6 2001-01-08 major simplification to bat files.

 3.7 2001-01-08 treat 0A as volatile for cmoschk.

 3.8 2002-02-15 new mailing address

 3.9 2006-02-05 different pad directories
                explanation of extended CMOS

 4.0 2008-01-02 add PAD, icon, renaming.

 4.1 2008-09-21 clarify use of standand and extended CMOS in docs.

 4.3 2009-03-10 provide ANT build
                refactor into three separate programs with common includes.
                remove all BAT files.
